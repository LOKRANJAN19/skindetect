                            Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which are found in the outer layer of the skin. SCC usually appears as a red, scaly patch, a sore that doesn’t heal, or a growth with a central depression. It can also develop in other areas like the mouth or throat.
